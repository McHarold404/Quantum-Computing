# Quantum Computing
A report on Quantum Computing for Algorithm Analysis and Design course duing Monsoon'20 	

# Description

For our project, we chose to explore the field of Quantum Computing and it's application in the world right now, and what they could be in the future.

We began by studying the prerequisites like Linear Algebra and basic understanding of quantum mechanics.
After that, we went on to study quantum computing through various lectures series and books/notes. 

Finally, after we had a good understanding on how things work in quantum world and the basic advantages it provides in computing, we further went on to study and understand a couple of research papers for our presentations. 

## Presentation and Report

Our report included a brief introduction to quantum mechanics and how it gave rise to quantum computing. It introduced and explained some of the basic fundamentals of quantum computing, the Principle of Delayed Measurement and Quantum Erasure. We then went on to explain the 3 cornerstone algorithms of computing computing in detail: 

1. Simon's Algorithm
2. Shor's Factoring Algorithm
3. Grover's Search Algorithm

Our presentation also included a talk about some of the interesting applications of quantum computing which we came across from research papers. These included

1. A Simple Proof that Toffoli and Hadamard are Quantum Universal by Dorit Aharonov
2. Prediction by linear regression on a quantum computer by Maria Schuld et all
3. Solution to 0/1 Knapsack Problem Based on Improved Ant Colony Algorithm by Hanxiao SHI
