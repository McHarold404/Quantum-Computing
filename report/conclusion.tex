\section{Takeaways}
Our major takeaways from studying quantum computing till now have been:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One of the most significant advantages that quantum computing provides is that qubits can exist in super positions which helps us to do parallel computations.
    \item Qubits can theoretically store infinite amount of information by being in a superposition state, but this information can not be accessed though, because of the anomaly of measurement and collapse of wave function.
    \item Quantum computing, by it's nature, works with matrices(since they are vectors in vector space of possible quantum states). This provides us speed ups in performing unitary matrix operations. This is the major mathematical advantage they provide apart from parallel computations.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Future plans}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learn about the application of quantum computing in field of medicine and finance.
    \item Read research paper about quantum algorithms for machine learning and how it can be used to optimize the existing algorithms.
    \item Study about quantum hardware, how our algorithms might be limited by the garbage qubits they might require, how the comparison of complexity actually translate into time (e.g, 100 quantum gates might actually be slower than 10000000 classical gates!) and how quantum gates and qubits can be efficiently incorporated with classical computers.
\end{enumerate}
